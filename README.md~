# camera_ext_calibration

Documents present : 

->  LMa_cameracalib_fixedIntrinsics
LMa for Camera Calibration Parameters Refinement, using LMA algorithm computed by hand

->  LMa_cameracalib_fixedIntrinsics_lsqcurvefit
same as before, but using matlab

-> CamExtrinsicsCalibrationClass 
the class , see line 50 (adding noise) -> need to choose a good way to do this.

Problems : 
How, where to add the noise for testing. 
Should use another optimizer ?
